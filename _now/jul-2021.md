2. I took a break from boxing.
3. I'm actually plant-based. I eat donuts though. Sorrynotsorry.

## Thoughts

Life over 2020 has been a cycle of unmet desires and empty fulfillment. 
Quiet desperation undergirds our attempts to quench thirst with salt water.

Rather than assume that my goal is to change my circumstances, I think it's wiser to instead believe that your goal is to be as present as possible.
Presence to me is the utmost willingness to play the role that God intended to assign you. Life isn't always about breaking free. Maybe you're needed right now!

Since none of us know what'll happen next, it's in our best interest to cultivate our relationship with Him. We travel through time as a car does at night--we can only perceive what is immediately in front of us. Our connection with the Holy Spirit allows us to navigate safely. After all, what's our perspective compared to His?
