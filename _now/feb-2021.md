## 1. Polishing this website

Scope for this site quickly grew beyond what I originally intended, but I enjoyed picking up a new framework. The workflow is pretty well-integrated right now. I can just create local markdown files, push straight to Github, and automatically get a fresh deploy.

Things are happening slowly, but I'm pretty happy with the quality thus far.

## 2. Starting to lift again

I'm entering week two of a simple, barbell-based 5x5 strength training program. Recent DEXA scans indicate that the circumstances of 'rona have lead to some muscle tradeoffs. I'm trading most of my running for a push-pull-leg regimen. Cutting 10 lbs in a few months seems doable.

## 3. Career coaching

I specialize in helping people make career shifts into technology. I'm looking for curious, driven individuals. If you know one (or are one), feel free to find me.
