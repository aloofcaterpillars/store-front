## Achievements Unlocked

1. I hit 141 and will likely break that after this ongoing 5-day fast (currently on day 2). Despite losing LBM, I've mostly maintained my strength levels. It's not nearly what it used to be, but I'm starting to commit to my rings and calisthenics training. Thus, I don't have to view compound lifts as the pure strength metric anymore.

2. By temporarily letting go of my quest to compete in boxing, I've learned that I don't need external validation for internal confidence. I've relearned this truth at various times throughout life, and each subsequent experience reinforces the fact that my mere existence is enough. I don't have to do anything to deserve love. What a truth to grasp! Since then, I've since gained better control over my vices, my kneejerk reactions, and my insecurities. I don't know if I'll end up ever being able to compete. I might still box. Who knows.

3. Completed the 4x4x48 challenge. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're absolutely crazy. More thoughts to come later.

## Goals

1. Complete a full-stack NFT project (blockchain to UI)
2. Run 5 miles at a 6:30 pace
3. Find an opportunity to work on ministry
